## âœ… Ways to Create a Thread

```java
1. Extending Thread Class

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // starts a new thread
    }
}

2. Implementing Runnable Interface
 
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start(); // starts a new thread
    }
}

âœ… Thread vs Runnable

Feature	           Thread	                        Runnable
Inheritance	       Not flexible (extends Thread)	Flexible (can extend another class)
Usage              Less used in real-world	      Preferred in real-world
Structure	         extends  Thread	              implements Runnable

âœ… start() vs run()

Method	Behavior
start()	Starts a new thread and executes the run() method inside it
run()	  Executes like a normal method in the current thread

âœ… Real-World Analogy: IRCTC Booking Example
 
class Booking extends Thread {
    private String user;

    Booking(String user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println(user + " booking started");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // simulating booking delay
        } catch (Exception e) {}
        System.out.println(user + " booking done");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Booking("Rahul").start();
        new Booking("Priya").start();
    }
}


ðŸ§  MCQs & Answers
Which method starts a thread? â†’ start()

Interface for multithreading? â†’ Runnable

run() method is in? â†’ Runnable

run() called directly? â†’ Runs in main thread (not separate)

Production usage preferred? â†’ Runnable

Which allows behavioral inheritance? â†’ Runnable

What does Thread.sleep(2000) do? â†’ Pauses for 2 seconds

Thread class implements? â†’ Runnable

If you override run() and call it directly? â†’ No new thread is created

Which is preferred: Runnable or Thread? â†’ Runnable

âœ… Summary
Use Runnable in real-world applications for flexibility and cleaner design.

Always use .start() to begin a new thread; do not call run() directly.

Thread class is used when you want to override thread-specific behavior directly.

Multithreading helps improve responsiveness in real apps like IRCTC, Zomato, and Paytm.
