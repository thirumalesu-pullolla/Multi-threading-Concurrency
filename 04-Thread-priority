âœ… What is Thread Priority?
    Each thread in Java is assigned a priority (an integer between 1 and 10).
    
    Higher priority means the thread gets more preference by the CPU (not guaranteed, depends on OS scheduler).
    
    Default priority = 5

ðŸ”¢ Priority Constants from Thread Class:
 
    Thread.MIN_PRIORITY   // 1
    Thread.NORM_PRIORITY  // 5
    Thread.MAX_PRIORITY   // 10

âœ… Setting and Getting Priority
 
    Thread t = new Thread();
    t.setPriority(8);     // sets priority
    int p = t.getPriority(); // gets priority

ðŸ›µ Real-World Analogy: Zomato Delivery
    Zomato Gold users â†’ High priority â†’ Get faster delivery
    
    Normal users â†’ Medium priority
    
    Free users â†’ Lower priority â†’ May wait longer
    
    Similarly, CPU may prefer higher-priority threads for execution.
