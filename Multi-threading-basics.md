 # Step 1: Introduction to Multithreading in Java

## üß† What is Multithreading?

Multithreading is the ability to run multiple tasks at the **same time** in a single program.  
In Java, each task is executed in a **Thread**.

### Real-World Analogy: Indian App Examples

- **IRCTC Train Booking**:  
  - One thread fetches train list, another fetches seat availability, and another handles payment.
  
- **Zomato App**:  
  - One thread loads your location, another fetches the restaurant list, and another loads offers/coupons.

### Key Points:
- **Thread** = Small unit of a process that runs independently.
- **Multithreading** = Running multiple tasks at the same time inside a single program.
- **Concurrency** = Managing multiple threads running simultaneously.
- **Parallelism** = Threads actually running at the same time across multiple cores.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why is Multithreading Important?

| Without Multithreading | With Multithreading |
|:--|:--|
| Tasks happen one by one (slow) | Tasks happen together (fast) |
| Bad user experience | Smooth user experience |
| CPU is idle often | CPU fully utilized |

## üìö Important Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| **Thread** | A small unit of a process that can run independently. |
| **Process** | A complete program running (can have multiple threads). |
| **Concurrency** | Managing multiple threads at the same time. |
| **Parallelism** | Actually executing multiple threads at the same time (multiple CPU cores).

## üéØ Quick Summary:
- **Thread** = Small worker doing a job.
- **Multithreading** = Multiple workers doing multiple jobs at once.
- **Used in IRCTC, Zomato, Paytm** daily.
- **Gives speed, efficiency, better CPU usage**.

## üìã Quick Summary of Key Concepts:
- **Thread**: A lightweight unit of execution in a process.
- **Multithreading**: Allows a program to do multiple tasks at once.
- **Concurrency**: Managing multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Parallelism**: Tasks happening truly at the same time (on multiple cores).

## IMP points : 

What is a Thread in Java?
A thread is a small unit of a process that runs independently.

What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is running multiple tasks at the same time inside a single program.

Which Indian app is a good example of Multithreading?
IRCTC, Google Maps, and Instagram are good examples of multithreading.

What is the main advantage of Multithreading?
The main advantage is better CPU usage and a faster user experience.

In Java, a Process can have how many threads?
A process can have many threads.

What is Concurrency?
Concurrency is the management of multiple threads.

Which one is NOT a benefit of Multithreading?
Wasting CPU power is not a benefit of multithreading.

Parallelism happens when:
Threads actually run at the same time on multiple CPU cores.

In multithreading:
Tasks happen independently of each other.

Which term means "full running program"?
A process is a full running program.
